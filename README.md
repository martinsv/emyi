Sleek, intuitive, and powerful PHP micro-framework for faster and easier web development.

## Minimum Requirements
PHP 5.5

## Why Emyi?
Why not?

Emyi was written to meet three library requirements: good performance, standalone objects, and interoperability. It aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as RoR, ASP.NET MVC and even Sinatra.

Emyi is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large and robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
